# A Text Back 

"A Text Back" is a web interface that displayes markov generated text in the expression of text messages to respond like me by being based on the patterns of my language. The dataset used to generate the texts is from exported text conversations between me and friends, me and family, and me and my boyfriend. The complete dataset is not publically available and the generated texts have been curated for privacy reasons. However, the curated list of generated texts exist on are.na here >https://www.are.na/lexahl/lex-texts<
